# SoloAracde  üïπÔ∏è

SoloArcade was a project that I made as one of my final assignments in my AP Computer Science A class. It provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to launch GUI windows for two classic strategy games - Sudoku and Tic Tac Toe. The program allows the user to choose between the games by responding with 's' for Sudoku or 't' for Tic Tac Toe.

## Requirements
To run the program, you need to have the following installed:

> Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Compile the source files:
``` bash
javac Main.java Sudoku.java TicTacToe.java
```

3. Run the program:
``` bash
java Main
```

## How to Play
1. Launch the program in the command-line as instructed above.

2. The program will prompt you to choose a game:
    - Type 's' and press Enter to launch Sudoku.
    - Type 't' and press Enter to launch Tic Tac Toe.
3. If you choose Sudoku:
   - A GUI window for Sudoku will appear, allowing you to play the game interactively.
   - Follow the rules of Sudoku to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetition in rows, columns, or boxes.
4. If you choose Tic Tac Toe:
   - A GUI window for Tic Tac Toe will appear.
   - Take turns placing 'X' and 'O' symbols on the 3x3 grid.
   - The first player to align three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
